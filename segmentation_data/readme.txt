Digital Database for Screening Mammography segmentation annotation data
The images files in this directory are 66 Digital Database for Screening Mammography (DDSM) mammograms and the corresponding manual annotations of mammograms which show
the fibroglandular, adipose, and pectoral muscle tissue regions. The dataset includes manual annotations for 16 Type A, 20 Type B, 17 Type C, and 13 Type D mammograms.
Manual annotation file names are the original mammogram file name concatenated with “_LI”, which stands for “labelled image”. Mammograms and the manual annotations have
a resolution of 960x480. 64, 128, 192, and 255 intensity pixels in the manual annotations show background, adipose tissue, fibroglandular tissue, and pectoral muscle
tissue regions, respectively. The images are grayscale. Mammograms and manual annotations  are located under fgt_seg and fgt_seg_labels directory. You may find the
methods about preprocessing of mammograms and manual annotations in our journal article.
